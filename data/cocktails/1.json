  "description": "Invented in the 1920s in honor of the Rudolph Valentino film of the same name, the Blood & Sand has withstood the test of time for almost 100 years. This classic is made by combining equal parts Scotch, sweet vermouth, Cherry Heering (the “blood”), and orange juice (the “sand”), although modern bartenders frequently adjust the proportions to tone down its sweetness."
